<h2> Dance Journal </h2>
<p> Hi, my name is Bastion Fennell. I started learning how to dance as mostly a test dummy for a friend of mine doing WCS. Shortly after that, I joined Texas Ballroom at the University of Texas in the fall of 2014. We were learning so much at Texas Ballroom that I decided I should put together a small journal so I didn't forget anything. That's what this site is. It holds each of the dances I'm learning, what I'm learning, and hopefully some video demonstrations. Perhaps my journey will be helpful for someone else as well! </p>
